<objective>
Write operational README with setup, secrets, deploy, and pre-release checklist.

Purpose: Enable any new engineer to set up, run, and deploy the project. Document where secrets live and what to check before release.
Output: README.md at project root.

  <name>Task 1: Create operational README.md</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Create README.md at project root with these sections:

**1. Overview** — One paragraph: multi-business planning and scenario calculator web app (from PROJECT.md "What This Is").

**2. Tech Stack** — Bullet list: React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, Firebase (Auth + Firestore), Jotai, Gemini AI, Perplexity API, @react-pdf/renderer.

**3. Prerequisites** — Node.js 20+, npm, Firebase CLI (`npm i -g firebase-tools`), gcloud CLI (for pull-prod script).

**4. Getting Started**
- `git clone` + `npm install`
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values
- Explain each env var briefly (Firebase config, Gemini key, Perplexity key)
- Note: Firebase API key is safe to expose (restricted by Firestore rules), but AI keys are client-side and should be moved to backend proxy (Phase 16)

**5. Local Development**
- Terminal 1: `npm run emulator` (starts Firestore emulator on :8080, UI on :4000)
- Terminal 2: `npm run dev` (starts Vite on :5173)
- Note: In dev mode, Firestore auto-connects to emulator (see src/lib/firebase.ts)
- `npm run pull-prod` — pulls production Firestore data into local emulator (requires `gcloud auth application-default login`)

**6. Available Scripts** — Table of all npm scripts with descriptions.

**7. Project Structure** — Brief overview of src/ directories: app/, components/, features/, hooks/, lib/, store/, types/.

**8. Deployment**
- `npm run build` — TypeScript check + Vite production build
- `firebase deploy --only hosting` — deploy to Firebase Hosting
- `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` — deploy Firestore security rules
- Note: Deployed to `my-business-planning.web.app`

**9. Environment Variables** — Table: variable name, required/optional, description, where to get it.

**10. Pre-Release Checklist**
- [ ] `npm run build` passes
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes
- [ ] Test key user flows (create business, edit section, scenario modeling, export PDF)
- [ ] Verify .env not committed (`git status` shows no .env)
- [ ] Check Firestore rules are up to date

Keep it concise — aim for ~150 lines. No emojis. Use standard markdown.
