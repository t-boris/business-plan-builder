<objective>
Build the Marketing Strategy, Operations, and Launch Plan section UIs with editable forms, pre-populated data, and Firestore auto-save using the shared useSection hook from 02-01.

Purpose: Second batch of section UIs — the operational and go-to-market sections. These sections are heavy on list/table data (channels, crew, timeline stages).
Output: 3 working section pages with forms, pre-populated with Fun Box marketing, operational, and launch data.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build Marketing Strategy section UI</name>
  <files>src/features/sections/marketing-strategy/index.tsx</files>
  <action>
  Replace the placeholder with a full form UI:

  1. Use `useSection<MarketingStrategy>('marketing-strategy', defaultMarketing)` where defaults use `DEFAULT_MARKETING_CHANNELS` from constants.ts + default offers and landing page data.

  2. **Marketing Channels section:** Render each channel as an expandable Card:
     - CardHeader: channel name (display name, not editable — 'Meta Ads', 'Google Ads', 'Organic Social', 'Partnerships'), budget (number Input with $)
     - CardContent (expandable or always visible):
       - Expected Leads (number Input)
       - Expected CAC (number Input with $)
       - Description (Textarea)
       - Tactics: list of editable strings, each as Input, with "Add Tactic" button and remove buttons
     - Display total monthly ad spend as a summary line above/below the channels

  3. **Offers section:** Editable list of promotional offers:
     - Each offer as an Input with remove button
     - "Add Offer" button
     - Pre-populate with offers from PROJECT.md:
       - "Free slime lab for March bookings"
       - "Free professional photos for April parties"
       - "Free custom cake topper"
       - "Free Museum Jellyfish tickets for birthday child"

  4. **Landing Page section:** Simple card with:
     - URL (Input)
     - Description (Textarea)
     - Pre-populate URL as empty, description with landing page requirements from PROJECT.md

  Layout: heading, channel cards in a 2-column grid (or stacked on mobile), offers list below, landing page card at bottom.

  **Do NOT** add calculated totals that depend on scenario atoms — that's Phase 3.
  **Each field change** triggers debounce-save via useSection hook.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds. Marketing Strategy page shows 4 channel cards with budgets ($1500, $500, $0, $200) and 4 offers.</verify>
  <done>Marketing Strategy page shows editable channel cards with tactics, offers list, and landing page section, all pre-populated with business data</done>

  <name>Task 2: Build Operations and Launch Plan section UIs</name>
  <files>src/features/sections/operations/index.tsx, src/features/sections/launch-plan/index.tsx</files>
  <action>
  1. Replace `src/features/sections/operations/index.tsx` with full form UI:
     - Use `useSection<Operations>('operations', defaultOperations)`
     - Default data:
       - crew: [{ role: "Party Host", hourlyRate: 20, count: 1 }, { role: "Photographer", hourlyRate: 25.50, count: 1 }, { role: "Assistant", hourlyRate: 18, count: 1 }] (from deep research labor costs)
       - capacity: { maxBookingsPerDay: 2, maxBookingsPerWeek: 8, maxBookingsPerMonth: 25 }
       - travelRadius: 25
       - equipment: ["Party bus", "Workshop supplies", "Slime lab materials", "Ocean decorations", "Sound system"]
       - safetyProtocols: ["Slime/chemical safety gloves for all participants", "First aid kit on-site", "Adult supervision ratio 1:5", "Museum emergency procedures briefing", "Allergy check before activities"]

     - **Crew table:** Rows with role (Input), hourly rate (number Input with $), count (number Input). "Add Crew Member" button. Remove per row.
     - **Capacity card:** 3 number inputs (per day, per week, per month) in a row
     - **Travel Radius:** Single number Input with "miles" label
     - **Equipment list:** Editable string list (Input per item, add/remove)
     - **Safety Protocols:** Editable string list with warning styling (yellow/amber badges)
       - Show deep research callout: "Slime/chemical activities carry documented dermatitis/burn risk" as an amber alert banner at top of safety section

     Layout: heading, crew table, capacity + travel radius in a row, equipment list, safety protocols with alert banner.

  2. Replace `src/features/sections/launch-plan/index.tsx` with full form UI:
     - Use `useSection<LaunchPlan>('launch-plan', defaultLaunchPlan)`
     - Default data (3 stages from PROJECT.md):
       - Stage 1 "Preparation" (before March 1, 2026): tasks = ["Package 3 service tiers", "Shoot video and photo content", "Build landing page", "Set up CRM or tracking spreadsheet"]
       - Stage 2 "Soft Launch" (March 1-14, 2026): tasks = ["Launch ads with small budget", "Test ad creatives", "Test promotional offers", "Collect initial feedback"]
       - Stage 3 "Scale" (from March 15, 2026): tasks = ["Increase ad budget", "Launch Google Ads", "Activate partnerships", "Build review collection system"]

     - **Timeline view:** Vertical timeline with 3 stage cards:
       - Each card: stage name (Input), start date (Input type=date), end date (Input type=date)
       - Tasks list within each stage: task name (Input) + status toggle (Select with "pending", "in-progress", "done" options)
       - Status badges: color-coded (gray=pending, blue=in-progress, green=done)
       - "Add Task" button per stage
       - "Add Stage" button at bottom

     Layout: heading, vertical timeline of stage cards with connecting line/border styling.

  **Pre-populate all safety protocols with deep research findings.**
  **Status toggles** should use shadcn/ui Select component with 3 options.
