# Phase 12: Integration & Polish - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The features all work — this phase is about making every screen look and feel like a real product. Someone opens this and thinks "this is a professional tool," not a side project or prototype.

The aesthetic is data-dense but well-organized — think Stripe Dashboard or Retool. Information-rich without feeling cluttered. The tool is a business planning platform, so it should feel powerful and trustworthy — the kind of thing you'd confidently show to an investor or business partner.

Every screen should meet the same quality bar: login, onboarding, dashboard, section editors, scenario modeling, export — all of it. No screen should feel like an afterthought.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Professional impression across every screen** — uniform quality bar from login to PDF export. Nothing looks "bolted on" or prototype-quality.
- **Rich, dashboard-y aesthetic** — data-dense but well-organized. Stripe/Retool vibe — feels powerful, not minimal-for-minimal's-sake.
- **Cohesive design system** — colors, spacing, typography, component styling all feel like one product, not 12 features assembled over time.

## Specific Ideas

- Design inspiration: Stripe Dashboard, Retool — information-rich but well-organized
- Not going for a minimalist/Linear aesthetic — this is a data tool and should feel like one
- The exported business plan and PDF are things users show to others — these are the "showcase" screens

## Additional Context

This is the final phase of a 12-phase transformation from a single-business Fun Box app to a generic multi-business planning platform. All features are functional — 31 of 33 plans completed across 11 phases. The focus now shifts entirely to visual quality and professional feel. The user deploys this for their own businesses and wants it to feel like a real SaaS product.
