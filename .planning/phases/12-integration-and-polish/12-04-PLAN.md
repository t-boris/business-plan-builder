<objective>
Polish section editors part 1: Executive Summary, Market Analysis, Product/Service, Marketing Strategy.

Purpose: Section editors are where users spend most of their time. They need to feel organized and powerful — data-dense forms with clear hierarchy, consistent card patterns, and refined chart styling. Each section should feel like part of the same product.
Output: Four polished section editors with unified header, form, and visualization patterns.

  <action>
  Apply consistent visual patterns to both section editors:

  **Common patterns for ALL section pages (apply to both):**
  - Use `PageHeader` component from 12-01 for section title + description
  - Place the `AiActionBar` in the PageHeader's children slot (right-aligned alongside the title)
  - Wrap content sections in cards with `card-elevated` class
  - Subsection titles: `text-sm font-semibold text-muted-foreground uppercase tracking-wide` (consistent)
  - Form labels: `text-sm font-medium` above inputs
  - Input spacing: `space-y-4` between fields, `gap-4` in grids
  - List items (add/remove): consistent row layout with trash icon right-aligned, ghost button

  **Executive Summary:**
  - Summary field: full-width Textarea in its own card
  - Mission + Vision: side-by-side cards in `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4`
  - Key Highlights: list in a card with "+ Add Highlight" button at bottom (outline variant, sm size)
  - AI preview: ensure the purple-themed preview has consistent spacing with the rest

  **Market Analysis:**
  - Market Size stat cards: use `stat-grid` utility class from index.css
  - Cards for TAM and Target Market Share: apply `card-elevated`, refine the colored accent (subtle left border instead of full background)
  - Demographic stat cards grid: standardize at `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-5 gap-3`
  - Competitor table: clean table styling with `text-sm`, alternating subtle row backgrounds in light mode
  - Charts (bar chart, pie chart): standardize height at `h-[240px]`, use CSS variable colors from `--chart-*`
  - Zip code tag inputs: cleaner badge styling for zip codes
  - Research section: consistent card treatment with subtle border, collapsible header with clean chevron rotation

  Do NOT change data schemas, hook calls, AI integration, or section data logic.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build`. Verify both section pages render correctly with polished styling.</verify>
  <done>Executive Summary has clean card layout with PageHeader and AI bar. Market Analysis has refined stat cards, clean tables, and standardized charts. Both use consistent subsection titles and form patterns.</done>

  <files>src/features/sections/product-service/index.tsx, src/features/sections/marketing-strategy/index.tsx</files>
  <action>
  Apply consistent visual patterns:

  **Product/Service:**
  - Use `PageHeader` with AI bar in children slot
  - Package cards: refine the tier styling
    - Card: `card-elevated` base, with a subtle colored top border (2px) instead of full colored header background
    - Tier icon: inside a small colored circle (32px, light tint background)
    - Package name: `text-base font-semibold`
    - Price: `text-2xl font-bold tabular-nums` with currency prefix in `text-sm font-normal text-muted-foreground`
    - Duration/capacity: `text-xs text-muted-foreground` badges below price
    - Includes list: clean bulleted list with check icons (size-3.5, text-green-500)
    - Delete: ghost icon button, `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`
  - Grid: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 gap-4`
  - Add-ons: simpler card or list group with `border-b` between items
  - Empty states: use `EmptyState` component for no packages / no add-ons

  **Marketing Strategy:**
  - Use `PageHeader` with AI bar
  - Channel cards: refine styling
    - `card-elevated` with subtle colored left border (2px) matching channel color
    - Channel icon in small colored circle
    - Channel name: `text-sm font-semibold`
    - Fields (budget, audience, conversion rate): clean form grid within card
    - Status toggle: aligned right in card header
  - Budget pie chart: standardize at `h-[240px]`, use CSS variable colors, wrap in `card-elevated`
  - Offers section: clean list with `card-elevated` items
  - Landing page section: simple card with URL + description fields
  - Tooltips: ensure consistent trigger (HelpCircle icon, size-3.5, `text-muted-foreground`)

  Do NOT change data schemas, hook calls, AI integration, or section data logic.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build`. Verify both sections render with polished package/channel cards and charts.</verify>
  <done>Product/Service has refined tier cards with subtle colored borders and clean pricing display. Marketing Strategy has polished channel cards, consistent chart styling, and clean form grids. Both use PageHeader and EmptyState patterns.</done>
