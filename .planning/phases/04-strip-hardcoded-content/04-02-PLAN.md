<objective>
Replace all Fun Box hardcoded default data in the first 6 business plan section components with empty/generic defaults that create clean, inviting empty states.

Purpose: Section components should show empty forms with helpful placeholder text when no data exists, not Fun Box content.

Output: 6 section components with zero Fun Box content, sensible empty defaults, and working empty state UIs.

    **executive-summary/index.tsx:**
    - Replace `defaultSummary` with empty defaults: `{ summary: '', mission: '', vision: '', keyHighlights: [] }`
    - The component already handles empty keyHighlights array with "No highlights yet" message — verify this still works.
    - Remove Fun Box text from the default entirely (the ocean-themed description, Miami, jellyfish, packages).

    **market-analysis/index.tsx:**
    - Replace `defaultMarketAnalysis` with empty defaults:
      ```
      {
        targetDemographic: { ageRange: '', location: '', radius: 0, zipCodes: [] },
        marketSize: '',
        tamDollars: 0,
        targetMarketShare: '',
        competitors: [],
        demographics: { population: 0, languages: [], income: '', householdsWithKids: 0, annualTourists: 0 }
      }
      ```
    - Remove the hardcoded Miami competitors (Museum Party Co., Party Bus Miami, Kids Fun Factory).
    - Remove the hardcoded Miami-Dade demographics (2.7M population, English/Spanish/Haitian Creole, Median $55,000).
    - The `handleResearch` function currently hardcodes 'premium kids birthday party services ($800-$1,200 range)' as the research query. Change this to a generic placeholder or empty string — the user can enter their own business description via the zip code research feature.
    - Verify the component renders properly with empty competitors array and zero demographics values. The existing empty state messages should handle this.

    **product-service/index.tsx:**
    - Replace `defaultProductService` with empty defaults: `{ packages: [], addOns: [] }`
    - Remove the import of DEFAULT_PACKAGES from constants.ts (it was removed in 04-01).
    - Remove the hardcoded addOns list (Extra 30 minutes, Face painting, etc.).
    - The component needs a "no packages" empty state. Currently it only has empty states for addOns. Add a message when packages array is empty: "No packages yet. Use AI Generate to create initial packages, or add them manually."
    - Add a "Add Package" button near the Packages heading (similar to "Add Add-on" button pattern).
    - The `addPackage` function should be: add a new empty package `{ name: '', price: 0, duration: '', maxParticipants: 0, includes: [], description: '' }`.
    - Also add a `removePackage(index)` function and a remove button per package card.

    Do NOT change any UI layout, styling, or component structure beyond what's needed for empty states.
    Do NOT change the AI suggestion integration — it stays the same.

  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — no errors in these 3 files. Grep for "Fun Box|Miami|Ocean|Jellyfish|Museum Party|Party Bus" in these files returns no matches.</verify>
  <done>
    - All 3 components use empty/zero defaults
    - No Fun Box content in any default object
    - Empty state UI renders cleanly (empty arrays show helpful messages)
    - product-service has Add Package / Remove Package functionality
    - No TypeScript errors

    **marketing-strategy/index.tsx:**
    - Replace `defaultMarketing` with empty defaults:
      ```
      {
        channels: [],
        offers: [],
        landingPage: { url: '', description: '' }
      }
      ```
    - Remove import of DEFAULT_MARKETING_CHANNELS from constants.ts (removed in 04-01).
    - Remove Fun Box offers ("Free slime lab", "Free Museum Jellyfish tickets").
    - The component needs a "no channels" empty state message: "No marketing channels yet. Use AI Generate to create a marketing strategy, or add channels manually."
    - Add an "Add Channel" button. When adding a channel, create: `{ name: 'meta-ads', budget: 0, expectedLeads: 0, expectedCAC: 0, description: '', tactics: [] }`. This uses the first enum value as default since MarketingChannelName is still a union type.
    - Change the landing page URL placeholder from "https://funboxparty.com" to "https://yourbusiness.com".
    - Keep CHANNEL_DISPLAY_NAMES, CHANNEL_ICONS, CHANNEL_STYLES maps unchanged — they map enum values to display names, which is generic functionality.

    **operations/index.tsx:**
    - Replace `defaultOperations` with empty defaults:
      ```
      {
        crew: [],
        hoursPerEvent: 0,
        capacity: { maxBookingsPerDay: 0, maxBookingsPerWeek: 0, maxBookingsPerMonth: 0 },
        travelRadius: 0,
        equipment: [],
        safetyProtocols: [],
        costBreakdown: { all fields set to 0, customExpenses: [] }
      }
      ```
    - Remove Fun Box crew defaults (Party Host, Photographer, Assistant).
    - Remove Fun Box equipment defaults (Party bus, Workshop supplies, Slime lab materials, Ocean decorations).
    - Remove Fun Box safety protocols (Slime/chemical safety gloves, Museum emergency procedures).
    - Remove the Fun Box-specific safety warning banner about "Slime/chemical activities carry documented dermatitis/burn risk." Replace with a generic safety notice: "Define safety protocols relevant to your business operations."
    - The component already handles empty crew/equipment/safety arrays with messages — verify these work.
    - In the cost breakdown, the card titled "Museum Tickets" is Fun Box-specific. Rename it to "Venue / Tickets" to be generic. The fields (museumTicketPrice → label "Ticket/Venue price", ticketsPerEvent → label "Tickets per event") stay as fields but with generic labels.
    - In the per-event summary, change "Museum (X tickets x $Y)" to "Venue/Tickets (X x $Y)".
    - In the monthly total breakdown, change "Museum tickets" to "Venue/Tickets".
    - Keep all computation functions (computeCosts) and chart logic unchanged — they're generic math.

    **financial-projections/index.tsx:**
    - Replace `defaultFinancials` with empty defaults:
      ```
      {
        months: [],
        unitEconomics: { avgCheck: 0, costPerEvent: 0, profitPerEvent: 0, breakEvenEvents: 0 },
        seasonCoefficients: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
      }
      ```
    - REMOVE the exported `SEASON_PRESET_MIAMI_KIDS` constant (it's imported by dashboard — dashboard fix is in 04-03).
    - Keep SEASON_PRESET_FLAT and SEASON_PRESET_SUMMER_PEAK — they're generic presets.
    - Remove the "Miami Kids" seasonality preset button. Keep "Flat" and "Summer Peak" buttons.
    - Replace all references to `SEASON_PRESET_MIAMI_KIDS` within this file with `SEASON_PRESET_FLAT` as the fallback.
    - Remove the Fun Box-specific cost constants at the top (COST_PER_EVENT_LABOR = 254, COST_PER_EVENT_SUPPLIES = 75, COST_PER_EVENT_MUSEUM = 225, COST_PER_EVENT_TRANSPORT = 19, MONTHLY_FIXED = 11650, MONTHLY_MARKETING = 2200, BASE_BOOKINGS = 20).
    - The `generateMonthsFromCoefficients` function depends on these constants. Since defaults are now empty (months: []), this function is only called when "Recalculate Projections" is clicked. Update it to accept parameters instead of using module-level constants: `generateMonthsFromCoefficients(coefficients, avgCheck, costPerEvent, monthlyFixed, monthlyMarketing, baseBookings)`. Pull values from the section's unitEconomics data when recalculating.
    - The break-even formula in `updateUnitEconomics` uses `MONTHLY_MARKETING + MONTHLY_FIXED`. Replace with data-driven values: use a simple calculation based on the section's own data (sum of first month's marketing + fixed costs), or just use 0 as fallback if months array is empty.
    - The `addMonth` function uses MONTHLY_MARKETING and MONTHLY_FIXED for new month defaults. Use 0 for both since there are no hardcoded defaults anymore.
    - Remove the unit economics helper text "Labor $254 + Supplies $75 + Museum $225 + Transport $19". Replace with generic: "Computed from operations cost breakdown".
    - The MONTH_NAMES array starting from 'Mar 2026' is Fun Box-specific (launch date). Change to generic month labels: ['Month 1', 'Month 2', ..., 'Month 12']. Keep MONTH_LABELS as ['M1', 'M2', ..., 'M12'] or just use month numbers.

    Do NOT change chart components (AreaChart, BarChart, PieChart) — they're generic visualization.
